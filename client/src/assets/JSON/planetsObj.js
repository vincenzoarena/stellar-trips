Since then the operation has been buried. The only achievement of the cooperation between the Mars-Society and Stellar-Trips inc. was the “House Of Hades” a heat resistant modular Station that generates its own power and materials out of the same hell like environment surrounding it - until the day it is the most efficient station in the solar-system which explains its fast expansion. The initial insignificant status of this station turned fast into a sub cultural meet and greet and is even home to a couple of well known Rock and metal groups, who perform exclusive Events inside a huge transparent cupola under the firestorms of Venus and the shadows of the “House Of Vulcan” that hosts Venus travelers from all over the Solar system. The west branch of the station has it's own flair, with a clandestine atmosphere of coffee shops the famous red-light-district music clubs and restaurants. The opening of “The Roman Baths”, were an attempt to change the despicable reputation of the station but the extension of the spa area lead - due to employment shortages - to the merge of the red-light-district and the “Holiday Spa” areal.",
